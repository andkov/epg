# Data Origin

Behind the scene, the Square system creates a database, which stores data in multiple tables (e.g. transactions, payments, customers, etc.), but not all of them are used: it pretty much depends on the business and how you set it up (various taxes, fees, promotions, etc). I have used [this guide](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/05/analyzing-customer-data-from-square/) to setup a connection to the EPG Square account via an API. 

I've extracted only the fields that made sense to me and offered analytic potential. We can explore what else could be extracted, but so far, this is it. 

Expand the fold below to read how this data set was created (only if you'd like, but it's more for transparency of the report, I'll explain everything you need to know about the data to make sense of the results).

# Data Description

The report is structured as a series of interactions with the data set `ds_sales` which contains all sales transactions of the Edmonton Potters' Guild (EPG) since the launch of the [Square Payment system](https://tinyurl.com/2hzv8z9p) in October of 2015.

```{r}
ds_sales %>% explore::describe_all() %>% neat(caption="Table 1: Statistical properties of the columns")
```

### Identifiers

The first three columns are unique identifiers of transactions, sales, and customers, respectively. 
Each row of the data set `ds_sales` is a payment transaction registered by the Square system.

```{r}
ds_sales %>% 
  summarize(
    row_count        = n()
    ,transaction_count = n_distinct(transaction_id)   
    ,payment_count    = n_distinct(payment_id)
    ,customer_count   = n_distinct(customer_id) 
  ) %>% 
  neat(caption = "Table 2: Count of unique identifiers")
```

The Square system differentiates transactions and sales, because there could be other transactions besides sales (e.g. "Refund"), but I haven't observed any it in our records. The table above (Table 2) shows that each row contains a transaction, and there are as many transaction as sales, therefore we just verified that in this data set __each row is a sale__.

Also notice that there are fewer unique customer ids than rows. Partially, this could be explained by the fact that in 54% of transactions are missing the customer ids (see Table 1, more on why this is so later). However, when we remove sales with missing customer ids, we still have a few customers that made multiple sales:

```{r}
ds_sales %>% 
  filter(!is.na(customer_id)) %>% 
  summarize(
    row_count        = n()
    ,transaction_count = n_distinct(transaction_id)   
    ,payment_count    = n_distinct(payment_id)
    ,customer_count   = n_distinct(customer_id) 
  )
```

> CLARIFICATION needed: how does Square assign customer id? 


### Dates 

The next two columsn store the date of the sale in two formats, one with the exact time of the sale and one without
```{r}
ds_sales %>% 
  select(sale_datetime, sale_date) %>% 
  glimpse()
  
```


### Tenders

The columns in the next section were extracted from the `tender` component of the transactions table

```{r}
ds_sales %>% 
  select(money_spent,payment_type, card_type, last_4 ) %>% 
  glimpse(50)

ds_sales %>% 
  select(money_spent,payment_type, card_type) %>% # too many categories in `last_4`
  tableone::CreateTableOne(data=.) 
```

### Payments

Lastly, the details of the payments are were extracted from the payments table

```{r}
ds_sales %>% 
  select(collected_amount, net_amount, gross_amount, tax_total, processing_fee) %>% 
  tableone::CreateTableOne(data=.)
```








```{r graph-1, echo = echo_chunks, results='show', message=message_chunks}
ds_sales %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=sale_date))+
  geom_histogram()+
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "year")
```

```{r graph-2, echo = echo_chunks, results='show', message=message_chunks}

```

## Q1 - When, How many, How much

The Guild conducted multiple sales since payment via Square was in October of 2015. What are the dates on which the sales took place, how many items were sold, and what was the total amount paid?

```{r q-1, echo = echo_chunks, results='show', message=message_chunks}
ds_sales %>%
  group_by(sale_date) %>% 
  summarize(
    transaction_count = n_distinct(transaction_id)
    ,customer_count  = n_distinct(customer_id)
    ,card_count = n_distinct(last_4)
    ,collected_total = sum(money_spent, na.rm = T)
    ,processing_fees = sum(-processing_fee, na.rm =T)
    ,tax_total = sum(tax_total, na.rm =T)
  )
```
